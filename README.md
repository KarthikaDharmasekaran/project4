### ABOUT AIRBNB ANALYSIS ###:
                 "Airbnb is an American San Francisco-based company operating an online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays and experiences. The company acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com. The company is credited with revolutionizing the tourism industry, while also having been the subject of intense criticism by residents of tourism hotspot cities like Barcelona and Venice for enabling an unaffordable increase in home rents, and for a lack of regulation".

### PROBLEM STATEMENT ###:
                 This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The objectives are to:

               1.  Establish a MongoDB connection, retrieve the Airbnb dataset, and ensure efficient data retrieval for analysis.

               2.    Clean and prepare the dataset, addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.

               3.  Develop a streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

               4.  Conduct price analysis and visualization, exploring variations based on location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.

               5. Analyze availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations using suitable visualizations.

               6. Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.

               7.   Create interactive visualizations that enable users to filter and drill down into the data.

               8.   Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
